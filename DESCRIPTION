Description: Generation of natural looking noise has many application
    within simulation, procedural generation, and art, to name a few. The
    'ambient' package provides an interface to the 'FastNoise' C++ library
    and allows for efficient generation of perlin, simplex, worley, cubic,
    value, and white noise with optional perturbation in either 2, 3, or 4
    (in case of simplex and white noise) dimensions.
