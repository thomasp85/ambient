`ambient` is a an R package that provides access to the 
[FastNoise](https://github.com/Auburns/FastNoise) C++ library for generating
noise. As such it provides fast generation of perlin, value, cubic, and worley
noise in 2 and 3 dimensions, as well as simplex and white noise in 2, 3, and 4
dimensions.

Most of the noise patterns can be generated as fractals as well with support for
fbm, billow and rigid-multifractal, and can optionally be pertubed.

There's not much more to it. If you are in need of a noise generator `ambient`
is your friend, if not you probably shouldn't care.

## Installation
For the time being `ambient` is only available on Github, and can be installed
with `devtools`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('thomasp85/ambient')
```

In the future the package will be available on CRAN as well.

## Examples
Following is a couple of examples of the noise patterns possible with `ambient`:

```{r}
library(ambient)
plot_raster <- function(mat) {
  mat <- (mat - min(mat)) / diff(range(mat))
  plot(as.raster(mat))
}

# Simplex
plot_raster(noise_simplex(c(500, 500)))

# Simplex - No fractality
plot_raster(noise_simplex(c(500, 500), fractal = 'none'))

# Worley (cellular)
plot_raster(noise_worley(c(500, 500)))

# Worley - with pertubation
plot_raster(noise_worley(c(500, 500), pertubation = 'normal', pertubation_amplitude = 40))
```
